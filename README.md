## about<br>

**snake game in python**<br>

## current issues

- I think apple can spawn underneath snake body
- can't close window on game over screen because of pg.time.wait
- ex. when you're going left if you press up then right super fast, you die
- sometimes the apple stops moving (or maybe it's just luck)

## new features to add

- display score at end of game
