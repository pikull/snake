## about

**snake game in python**<br>

## how to play

**important**<br>
make sure you have pygame installed through pip<br>
then run main.py file :)<br><br>
wasd or arrows to move<br>

## current issues

- I think apple can spawn underneath snake body
- can't close window on game over screen because of pg.time.wait
- sometimes the apple stops moving (or maybe it's just luck)

## new features to add

- display score at end of game
